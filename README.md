IgniTS is a CLI tool that simplifies initializing TypeScript libraries using the [npm-lib-template](https://github.com/Diman1988/npm-lib-template). It automates the setup process, allowing you to quickly create projects with essential configurations.

## Features

- Automated configuration of the [npm-lib-template](https://github.com/Diman1988/npm-lib-template).
- User-friendly prompts for basic library information.

## Installation and Usage
